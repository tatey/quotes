Nomwin: It’s okay to use something “not OS X like” you know. The world won’t end.
Nomwin: It just means you can bitch at him endlessly because even though it streamlines your workflow and makes you a hundred times more  productive,
Nomwin: it uses right-click instead of the “squeeze the mouse and perform a gesture with your face” interface that Apple’s pioneering this week.
